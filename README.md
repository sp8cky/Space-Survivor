# Space-Survivor

## Concept
This project is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders using Unity, it's still in progress.

## Implemented Features:
- Player movement: Control the player character using the left and right arrow keys.
- Player shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets and destroy enemy invaders.
- Enemy invaders: Enemy units move horizontally and descend gradually towards the player. 
- Score system: Players earn points by shooting down enemy invaders. The current score is displayed on the screen.
- Health system: Players start with a certain amount of health. Player can gain and loose health to collision with items or enemies and when health reaches zero, the game ends.

## Customization Options:
- Adjust player movement speed: Players can tweak the movement speed of the player character in the PlayerController script.
- Modify enemy behavior: Users can customize various aspects of the enemy behavior, such as movement speed, spawn rate, and attack patterns, by adjusting parameters in the EnemyController script.
- Change game visuals: Users can replace the default sprites with their own artwork to customize the game's appearance.

## Important Notes:

- Compatibility: The game is designed for 2D gameplay and is compatible with both desktop and mobile platforms.
- Code Structure: The project follows a modular code structure, making it easy to understand and extend. Scripts are organized into logical components such as PlayerController, EnemyController, and GameManager.
