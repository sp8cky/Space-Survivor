# Space-Survivor

## Concept
This project is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders using Unity, see *Project status* for more information.

## Implemented Features:
- Player movement: Control the player character using the left and right arrow keys.
- Player shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets and destroy enemy invaders.
- Enemy invaders: Enemy units move horizontally and descend gradually towards the player. 
- Score system: Players earn points by shooting down enemy invaders. The current score is displayed on the screen.
- Health system: Players start with a certain amount of health. Player can gain and loose health to collision with items or enemies and when health reaches zero, the game ends.

## Important Notes:
- Unity Version: This project was developed using Unity LTS version 2022.3.26f1.
- Compatibility: The game is designed for 2D gameplay and is compatible with both desktop and mobile platforms.
- Code Structure: The project follows a modular code structure, making it easy to understand and extend. Scripts are organized into logical components such as PlayerController, EnemyController, and GameManager.
- Feedback and Contributions: I haven't been working with Unity for that long, Feedback and contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
